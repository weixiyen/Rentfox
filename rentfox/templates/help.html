				<h5>How do I make the most out of Rentfox?</h5>
				<p>
					Rentfox is currently in Beta.  We have finished
					creating the absolute foundation of our rental management software 
					and we are rapidly adding new features every week to make
					Rentfox more valuable to your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use Rentfox effectively, you should enter as much data
					in Rentfox as you can, as this data will be useful
					in upcoming features.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, adding photos to your units
					may not seem important now, but once we release the listing 
					manager this October, your personal web site 
					containing all your active listings will be ready to go immediately
					with no extra work on your part.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some things you should do to make the most of Rentfox:
					<ol>
						<li>Create all your rental properties.</li>
						<li>Add all units to each property.</li>
						<li>Create leases for each active unit.</li>
						<li>Add tenants to leases</li>
						<li>Upload photos & floorplans.</li>
						<li>Record all rental related expenses in Rentfox.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="faq-1">
				<h5>How can I add leases?</h5>
				<p>
					If you have added units numbers to your property, you can create leases.
					You should create leases because it automates the rent collection process
					so that you can collect rent by clicking one button. With leases, you will also be able
					see upcoming vacancies, auto-remind remind tenants to pay via SMS, track
					occupancy rates, auto-calculate late fee charges, and much more!
				</p>
				<p>Here's one way to add a lease:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Select your property from the properties menu.</li>
						<li>Select a unit from the right hand column.</li>
						<li>From the unit page, click on the giant "leases" tab on the left.</li>
						<li>Hover over the mini cog icon on the top right corner.</li>
						<li>Select "Create Lease" from the menu.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="faq-2">
				<h5>How can I add tenants?</h5>
				<p>
					Tenants can only be added to leases.  
					Here's one way to add a tenant:
					<ol>
						<li>Select your property from the properties menu.</li>
						<li>Select a unit from the right hand column.</li>
						<li>From the unit page, click on the giant "leases" tab on the left.</li>
						<li>Select the lease you want from the giant "leases" tab.</li>
						<li>Click on the "add tenant" link at the bottom of the lease.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="faq-3">
				<h5>Where can I find my tenants?</h5>
				<p>
					Currently Rentfox does not support listing of tenants in table format.
					However, you will be able to search for tenants using the 
					search box on the upper left.  Tenants can also be found on current
					or past leases on unit pages.  Unit pages can be found by clicking
					on a property, then clicking on the unit number on the right.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="faq-4">
				<h5>How do I collect Rent online?</h5>
				<p>
					Rentfox developers are currently working on a Resident Portal
					that will allow landlords to collect rent online from tenants automatically.
					Transaction fees will be kept as low as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					This feature will be released in December of 2010.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="faq-5">
				<h5>How do I advertise my vacancies?</h5>
				<p>
					Rentfox developers are currently working on a Listing Management
					system.  Features include a killer listings website, Craigslist posting,
					automatic online listing posting, prospective tenant scheduling,
					online rental applications &amp; rental application processing.
				</p>
				<p>
					This feature will be released in October of 2010.
